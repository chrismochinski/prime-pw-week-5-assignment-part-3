    <ul>
      <li>Is it okay that I used a for of loop to log the collection (rather than simply logging the array)? I thought it looked cleaner.</li>
      <li>I saw other people creating the object INLINE rather than with dot operators. Wasn't in curriculum, but thoughts? Seems elegant and simple.</li>
      <li>Stretch # 1 - the search function...did I get close? We haven't covered "null" yet, but I did some digging.</li>
      <li>At one point, my git status request said that DS_Store was modified. I'm curious how this happened (I may have just bumped something)</li>
