    <ul>
      <li>Is it okay that I used a for of loop to log the collection (rather than simply logging the array)? I thought it looked cleaner.</li>
      <li>I saw other people creating the object INLINE rather than with dot operators. Wasn't in curriculum, but thoughts? Seems elegant and simple.</li>
      <li>Stretch # 1 - the search function...did I get close? We haven't covered "null" yet, but I did some digging.</li>
      <li>At one point, my git status request said that DS_Store was modified. I'm curious how this happened (I may have just bumped something)</li>
      <li>Template literal with showing music (versus "regular syntax")...are these pretty interchangeable? What's "regular syntax" called?</li>
      <li> I occasionally use console.log() to insert a blank space, for clarity. There must be a better way to do this, right?</li>
      <li>I notice that, sometimes, when I open in browser and look at the console, things look somewhat blank (EG: it'll just say "array" rather than showing it). When I REFRESH, everything shows up. Is this an issue w/ Chrome, my Mac, JS, etc?</li>
      <li> *** Since the search argument is an anonymous object split up into two properties WITHIN the calling of the search function (artist and year), I'm pulling those in from that location...and pulling in the title and track listing from the global 'collection' variable. I wanted to copy the readme directions as exactly as possible. I hope I did this right cuz I worked QUITE hard on wrapping my head around it!)</li>
      <li> ## For practical application purposes, I hope the track title and duration weren't supposed to be separated. The two don't necessarily need to be separated - a track's name and duration is unchanging, so I kept it as one property. I hope this is okay! That's how I'd probably do it in the real world too. Love to hear your thoughts! </li>
